## Does being married have an effect on your political views?

Apurva Raman and William Lu

Politics has often been a polarizing subject amongst Americans, and in today's [increasingly partisan](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/opinion/charles-blow-politics-grow-more-partisan-than-ever.html) political environment, that has not changed. Using data from the [General Social Survey (GSS)](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/), an annual study designed and conducted by the [National Opinion Research Center (NORC)](http://www.norc.org/Pages/default.aspx) at the University of Chicago, we identify variables that are correlated with a person's political views. We find that while marital status has a statistically significant apparent effect on political views, that apparent effect is drastically reduced when including confounding variables, particularly religion.
