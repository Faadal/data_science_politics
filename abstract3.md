## Is being married a good predictor of your political views?

Apurva Raman and William Lu

Politics has often been a polarizing subject amongst Americans, and in today's [increasingly partisan](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/opinion/charles-blow-politics-grow-more-partisan-than-ever.html) political environment, that has not changed. Using the General Social Survey's (GSS) [data](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/) from 1987 to 2016, we tried to identify some variables that might be good predictor's of a person's political views. We found that marital status had a suprising apparent effect on a person's political views, but after further analysis have determined that many confounding variables need to be controlled for to determine whether marital status is a good predictor of political views.
